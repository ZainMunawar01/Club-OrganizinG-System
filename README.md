# Club-Organizing-System
This project is a Club Organizing System written in C++ designed to help organize and calculate the costs for outings with a group of senior citizens. The program calculates the total cost of an outing based on the number of participants, taking into account various costs like coach hire, meals, and tickets. It also allows for additional members to join and calculates profit or loss based on payments made.

Features
Calculate Outing Costs: Based on group size, calculates total outing costs including coach hire, meals, and theater tickets.
Individual Payment Collection: Collects and records payment from each participant, including additional members who may join later.
Profit/Loss Calculation: Calculates profit or loss based on total collected payments versus the calculated outing costs.
Additional Carers: Includes the option to add carers based on the group size and calculates their cost in the total budget.
How It Works
Group Size & Costs:

10-16 members: Coach cost is $150, meal cost is $14.00 per person, and theater ticket cost is $21.00 per person.
17-26 members: Coach cost is $190, meal cost is $13.50 per person, and theater ticket cost is $20.00 per person.
27-36 members: Coach cost is $225, meal cost is $13.00 per person, and theater ticket cost is $19.00 per person.
Cost Per Person & Carer Cost:

Calculates the cost per person and adds an additional amount for carers based on the group size.
Data Input for Each Citizen:

Prompts for each participantâ€™s name and payment, including optional additional participants.
Profit/Loss Calculation:

Compares total payment collected from participants against the outing costs and determines whether there was a profit or loss.
Code Structure
group1(), group2(), group3(): These functions calculate costs for groups of 10-16, 17-26, and 27-36 participants, respectively.
in_out(): This function handles participant data input, payment collection, additional participants, and profit/loss calculations.
main(): The main driver function that controls the program flow and prompts user input.
